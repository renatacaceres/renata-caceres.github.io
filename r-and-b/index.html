          <h3>Covid safe event</h3>
          <p> We want to make sure all our guests will be safe. As the weather changes into winter, we can expect an increase in the number of COVID cases in the US. For that reason, <strong>we kindly ask everyone attending to take a COVID test on the day of the event</strong>, and not attend if you test positive or if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness. We're happy to provide tests and bring them to you on the day of the event. We will require all the event staff and musicians to test as well. We will have high-quality masks available at the event for anyone who prefers to use them, but they are not required.</p>
            <p>We also highly encourage our guests to update their flu and COVID vaccinations this fall. A booster designed for newly circulating COVID variants should be available soon.</p>
            <p>With everyone’s collaboration, we can maximize the chances of a successful and safe event for everyone, especially those of advanced age.</p>

        <h3>How to get to Champaign, IL</h3>
        <p class="items">By plane:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The easiest way to arrive by flying is at the local <b>CMI</b> airport. This is also the most costly option and requires flying through ORD or DFW.</li>
        <li>For lower prices and more options, fly into one of Chicago’s airports, <b>ORD</b> or <b>MDW</b>.  Then rent a car and drive (ORD and MDW are about a 2h30m and 2h15m drive from Champaign, respectively, depending on traffic).  If you don’t want to rent a car, you can reserve the <a href="https://peoriacharter.com/" target="_blank">Peoria Charter</a> bus to Illinois Terminal in downtown Champaign (approximately 3-4h), or if you are a rail fan take a 30+ minute taxi or public transit ride to downtown Chicago and grab the Amtrak train to Champaign.</li>
        <li>Other choices are flying into <b>BMI</b> in Bloomington, IL (approximately 1h drive), or <b>IND</b> in Indianapolis (approximately 2h drive).</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="items">By train:</p>
       <ul><li><a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home.html" target="_blank">Amtrak</a> has two trains that stop in Champaign.</li></ul>

        <h3>Where to Stay</h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/illinois/hyatt-place-champaign-urbana/cmizc" target="_blank">Hyatt Place</a> (about $205/night including taxes & fees, via Expedia) is a high-quality hotel in downtown Champaign.  <a href="https://www.roysebrinkmeyer.com/inman" target="_blank">The Inman</a> is a historic hotel that was recently renovated; its management company is renting some rooms via Airbnb ($157).  Both are within an easy 3-block walk of the venue and a variety of nice restaurants, cafes, and shops.</p>
        <p>Many other hotels and AirBnBs are within a 5-10 minute drive.  The <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/cmiilhx-hampton-champaign-urbana/" target="_blank">Hampton Inn</a> ($121) is just 1 mile away. The <a href="https://stayatthei.com/" target="_blank">I-Hotel</a> ($169) is an upscale hotel run by the university, but far enough away to avoid the congestion of the main campus.   You can find these and others on your favorite travel site, or ask us if you have any questions.</p>
